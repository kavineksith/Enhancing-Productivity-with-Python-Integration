## IP Address and Subnet Calculator Documentation

### Overview
The IP Address and Subnet Calculator is a Python tool designed to facilitate calculations related to IP addresses and subnets. It offers various functionalities such as conversion of IP addresses to decimal, hexadecimal, and binary formats, calculation of subnet details including network address, broadcast address, total number of hosts, and more.

### Features
- **IP Address Conversion**: Convert IP addresses to decimal, hexadecimal, and binary formats.
- **Subnet Calculation**: Calculate subnet details including network address, broadcast address, total number of hosts, etc.
- **Input Validation**: Validate user inputs for IP addresses, CIDR notation, and IP version.
- **IPv4/IPv6 Class Identification**: Identify the class of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive command-line interface for ease of use.

### Installation
To use the IP Address and Subnet Calculator, follow these step:
   
   For IPv4 Versions:
   ```
   python ip_address_manager_v4.py
   ```
   For IPv6 Versions :
   ```
   python ip_address_manager_v6.py
   ```

### Usage
1. **Input Format**: Enter the IP address followed by the CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.1/24`).
2. **Interactive Interface**: Follow the prompts to input the IP address and CIDR notation. Type `exit` to exit the program.
3. **Output**: View the calculated results including IP type, network address, broadcast address, total number of hosts, and more.
