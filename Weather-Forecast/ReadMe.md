**Documentation: Weather Forecast Command-Line Application**

**1. Introduction:**
The Weather Forecast App is a Python-based command-line application that provides users with current weather conditions and forecasts for a specified city. Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, the app retrieves accurate weather data and presents it in an easy-to-understand format.

**2. Installation:**
- Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- Clone or download the source code from the GitHub repository.
- Navigate to the directory containing the code.
- Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key in the code.
- Run the script using the command `python weather_forecast.py`.

**3. Usage:**
Upon running the Weather Forecast App, the user is prompted to enter the name of a city. After inputting the city name, the app retrieves and displays the current weather conditions and a forecast for the next 5 days. If the city name is invalid or not found, appropriate error messages are displayed.

**4. Features:**
- Current Weather Display: Shows current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description for the specified city.
- Forecast Presentation: Displays the weather forecast for the next 5 days, including temperature highs/lows and weather descriptions.
- Input Validation: Validates user input to ensure only valid city names are accepted.
- Error Handling: Provides informative error messages for exceptions such as invalid data format or failed data retrieval.
- Clean Command-Line Interface: Offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

**5. Implementation:**
- **WeatherForecast Class:** Handles data retrieval from the OpenWeatherMap API and display of weather information.
- **InputValidator Class:** Validates user input using regular expressions to ensure valid city names.
- **Main Function:** Orchestrates the flow of the application, prompting users for input, validating it, and calling appropriate methods to fetch and display weather data.

**6. Error Handling:**
The Weather Forecast App employs robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully. It catches and handles exceptions such as failed data retrieval or invalid data format, providing informative error messages to the user.
